# KOPS Kubernetes Cluster Setup on AWS

## Overview

KOPS (Kubernetes Operations) is an open-source tool used to create, manage, upgrade, and maintain production-grade Kubernetes clusters on AWS.

In this lab, an EC2 instance acts as a **KOPS Management Server** from which KOPS and kubectl are installed and used to provision a Kubernetes cluster on AWS.

---

# Architecture Overview

## What is a Kubernetes Cluster?

A Kubernetes Cluster is a collection of machines working together to run containerized applications.

KOPS automatically provisions and manages the required AWS infrastructure.

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://abhis.kops.v1
```

### Verify

```bash
aws s3 ls
```

### Expected Output

```text
abhis.kops.v1
```

---

# Step 8: Enable Bucket Versioning

## Purpose

Protect cluster configuration against accidental modification or deletion.

### Navigate

```text
S3
→ abhis.kops.v1
→ Properties
→ Bucket Versioning
→ Enable
```

Save changes.

---

# Step 9: Configure KOPS State Store

## Purpose

Specify where KOPS stores cluster state information.

### Set Environment Variable

```bash
export KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://abhis.kops.v1
```

### Verify

```bash
echo $KOPS_STATE_STORE
```

### Expected Output

```text
s3://abhis.kops.v1
```

> Important: Use lowercase `s3://`.

Correct:

```text
s3://bucket-name
```

Incorrect:

```text
S3://bucket-name
```

---

# Step 10: Generate SSH Key

## Purpose

KOPS uses SSH keys to access cluster nodes.

### Generate Key Pair

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

Press:

```text
Enter

# Summary

This lab demonstrates the complete lifecycle of creating a Kubernetes cluster on AWS using KOPS:

1. Create a management server.
2. Configure AWS access.
3. Create an S3 state store.
4. Install KOPS and kubectl.
5. Define the cluster.
6. Provision AWS infrastructure.
7. Validate cluster health.
8. Manage the cluster using kubectl and KOPS.

KOPS automates the creation and management of production-grade Kubernetes clusters by provisioning and maintaining the required AWS resources.

# Cluster Deletion and Resource Cleanup

## Overview

Since the Kubernetes cluster was created using **KOPS**, it should also be deleted using **KOPS**.

Deleting the cluster through KOPS ensures that all associated AWS resources are removed correctly and helps prevent unnecessary AWS charges.

---

## Step 1: Verify Existing Cluster

### Check Current Cluster

```bash
kops get cluster
```

### Expected Output

```text
NAME
abhi.k8s.local
```

---

## Step 2: Preview Resources to Be Deleted

### Purpose

Review the resources that KOPS plans to remove before executing the deletion.

### Command

```bash
kops delete cluster --name abhi.k8s.local
```

### Resources Typically Listed

```text
EC2 Instances
Auto Scaling Groups
Load Balancers
Security Groups
VPC Components
IAM Resources Created by KOPS
```

> This command performs a dry run and does not delete resources.

---

## Step 3: Delete the Cluster

### Purpose

Remove the Kubernetes cluster and associated AWS resources.

### Command

```bash
kops delete cluster \
--name abhi.k8s.local \
--yes
```

### Example

```bash
kops delete cluster --name abhi.k8s.local --yes
```

---

## Step 4: Wait for Resource Cleanup

### Estimated Time

```text
5–15 Minutes
```

The deletion duration depends on:

- EC2 Instances
- Load Balancers
- Auto Scaling Groups
- Networking Resources

---

## Step 5: Verify Cluster Deletion

### Command

```bash
kops get cluster
```

### Expected Output

```text
No clusters found
```

---

## Step 6: Verify AWS Resource Cleanup

### EC2

Verify that no KOPS-managed instances remain:

```text
EC2 → Instances
```

Expected:

```text
No KOPS Instances
```

---

### Auto Scaling Groups

Verify removal of:

```text
Control Plane ASG
Worker Node ASG
```

---

### Load Balancers

Verify removal of:

```text
Kubernetes API Load Balancer
```

---

### VPC

KOPS often removes the VPC automatically.

Verify in:

```text
VPC Dashboard
```

Ensure no unused KOPS VPC resources remain.

---

## Step 7: Delete S3 State Store (Optional)

### Purpose

Remove the KOPS state store if you no longer need the cluster configuration.

### Example Bucket

```text
abhis.kops.v1
```

### Delete Bucket

```bash
aws s3 rb s3://abhis.kops.v1 --force
```

### Result

```text
Deletes all objects
Deletes the bucket
```

---

# Cost-Saving Checklist

After cluster deletion, verify that the following resources are no longer present:

```text
✅ EC2 Instances

✅ Load Balancers

✅ EBS Volumes

✅ Auto Scaling Groups

✅ NAT Gateways (if any)

✅ Elastic IP Addresses
```

These resources are the most common causes of unexpected AWS charges after lab activities.

# Commands Summary

```bash
# Check cluster
kops get cluster

# Preview deletion
kops delete cluster --name abhi.k8s.local

# Delete cluster
kops delete cluster --name abhi.k8s.local --yes

# Verify deletion
kops get cluster

# Optional: delete KOPS state store
aws s3 rb s3://abhis.kops.v1 --force
```

---

## Recommended Post-Deletion Verification

After deleting the cluster:

1. Verify all EC2 instances are terminated.
2. Verify all Load Balancers are removed.
3. Verify all EBS volumes are deleted.
4. Verify Auto Scaling Groups no longer exist.
5. Verify no Elastic IP addresses remain allocated.
6. Verify no NAT Gateways remain active.
7. Delete the S3 state store if it is no longer required.

This final verification helps ensure that no billable AWS resources remain from the KOPS cluster deployment.
